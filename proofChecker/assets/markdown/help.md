To enable editing, click on the input area (try different points if necessary). If input is active, the frame will turn blue and the cursor starts blinking.

You can edit the title by clicking on the blue bar.
  
You need a physical keyboard. 

The only way to move around the input area is through the keyboard (arrow keys, home, 
and end; delete and backspace). For editing the title, the only way to edit something you have already typed is by using backspace.

How to input logical symbols:
- &#x00AC; : &emsp; - (the minus sign)
-  &#x2227; : &emsp; ^ (shift-6 on US keyboard)
-  &#x2228; : &emsp; v or V (alphabet letter v--lower or upper case)
-  &#x2283; : &emsp; &gt; (greater than symbol)
-  ⊢ : &emsp; | followed by - (vertical line--shift-backslash on US keyboards--followed by the minus sign)
-  ... : &emsp; the dots for separating sequent from annotation. Type a single . (period) 
-  &#x0393; : &emsp; \ followed by G (backslash--usually right above the Enter key--followed by G)
-  &#x0394; : &emsp; \ followed by D
-  &#x0398; : &emsp; \ followed by T
- You can get a lot of other Greek letters by typing \ and following it by some  letter of the Roman alphabet (both upper and lower case). Try it!
- &#x2200; : &emsp; U (upper case U as in Universal; only if using predicate logic)
- &#x2203; : &emsp; X (upper case X as in eXists; only if using predicate logic)
- ≠ : &emsp; \ followed by =
- brackets: &emsp; the editor accepts only one type of brackets--the ordinary parentheses.


The following letters cannot be used for sentence, predicate, and term letters:
v, V, U, and X.

The editor will format your derivation on the fly. It is not possible to control the formatting.

Inference rules must be specified by abbreviations used in the course material (see README).

Theorems, if allowed, must be specified by abbreviations used in the course material (see README).
