How to input logical symbols:
- &#x00AC; : &emsp; - (the minus sign)
-  &#x2227; : &emsp; ^ (shift-6 on US keyboard)
-  &#x2228; : &emsp; v or V (alphabet letter v--lower or upper case)
-  &#x2283; : &emsp; &gt; (greater than symbol)
-  ‚ä¢ : &emsp; | followed by - (vertical line--shift-backslash on US keyboards--followed by the minus sign)
-  ... : &emsp; the dots for separating sequent from annotation. Type a single . (period) 
-  &#x0393; : &emsp; \ followed by G (backslash--usually right above the Enter key--followed by G)
-  &#x0394; : &emsp; \ followed by D
-  &#x0398; : &emsp; \ followed by T
- You can get a lot of other Greek letters by typing \ and following it by some alphabetical letter (both upper and lower case). Try it!
- &#x2200; : &emsp; U (upper case U as in Universal; only if using predicate logic)
- &#x2203; : &emsp; X (upper case X as in eXists; only if using predicate logic)
- brackets: &emsp; the editor accepts only one type of brackets--the ordinary parentheses.


The following letters cannot be used for sentence, predicate, and term letters:
v, V, U, and X.

Inference rules must be specified by the abbreviations used in the text for the course. 

Theorems, if allowed, must be specified by the abbreviations used in the text for the course.

When you click on one of the buttons at the top, the editor will stop accepting further input. You can resume input by clicking on the editor window.

If you need to start counting the lines at something other than 1, click on the first line number and you will be prompted for the desired number for the first line.

The editor will reformat on the fly all lines you are not currently editing. Some optional brackets may be removed or inserted as the case may be for readability purposes. If the reformatting does not happen, there is something wrong with your input.
