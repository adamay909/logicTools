<p>To enable editing, click on the input area (try different points if necessary). If input is active, the frame will turn blue and the cursor starts blinking.</p>
<p>Click on name of logical system to switch between Sentential and Predicate Logic.</p>
<p>You can edit the title by clicking on the blue bar.</p>
<p>You need a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>The only way to move around the input area is through the keyboard (arrow keys, home,
and end; delete and backspace). For editing title, deletion  only works with backspace.</p>
<p>How to input logical symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>¬ :   - (the minus sign)</li>
<li>∧ :   ^ (shift-6 on US keyboard)</li>
<li>∨ :   v or V (alphabet letter v--lower or upper case)</li>
<li>⊃ :   &gt; (greater than symbol)</li>
<li>⊢ :   | followed by - (vertical line--shift-backslash on US keyboards--followed by the minus sign)</li>
<li>... :   the dots for separating sequent from annotation. Type a single . (period)</li>
<li>Γ :   \ followed by G (backslash--usually right above the Enter key--followed by G)</li>
<li>Δ :   \ followed by D</li>
<li>Θ :   \ followed by T</li>
<li>brackets:   the editor accepts only one type of brackets--the ordinary parentheses.</li>
<li>You can get a lot of other Greek letters by typing \ and following it by some  letter of the Roman alphabet (both upper and lower case). Try it!</li>
<li>∀ :   U (upper case U as in Universal; only if using predicate logic)</li>
<li>∃ :   X (upper case X as in eXists; only if using predicate logic)</li>
<li>≠ :   \ followed by =</li>
<li>□ :   [ (left square bracket; if you want to do modal logic)</li>
<li>◇ :   &lt; (smaller-than symbol; if you want to do modal logic)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following letters cannot be used for sentence, predicate, and term letters:
v, V, U, and X.</p>
<p>The editor will format your derivation on the fly. It is not possible to control the formatting.</p>
<p>Inference rules must be specified by abbreviations used in the course material (see README).</p>
<p>Theorems and Axioms  must be specified by abbreviations used in the course material (see README).</p>
<p>You can add subscripts by typing _ (underscore) followed by a single character (WARNING: debugging for use of subscripts is incomplete)</p>
