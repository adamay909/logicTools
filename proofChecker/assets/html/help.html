<p>To enable editing, click on the rectangular input area (try different points if necessary). If input is active, the frame will turn blue and the cursor starts blinking.</p>
<p>The only way to move around the input area is through the keyboard (arrow keys, home,
and end).</p>
<p>How to input logical symbols:</p>
<ul>
<li>¬ :   - (the minus sign)</li>
<li>∧ :   ^ (shift-6 on US keyboard)</li>
<li>∨ :   v or V (alphabet letter v--lower or upper case)</li>
<li>⊃ :   &gt; (greater than symbol)</li>
<li>⊢ :   | followed by - (vertical line--shift-backslash on US keyboards--followed by the minus sign)</li>
<li>... :   the dots for separating sequent from annotation. Type a single . (period)</li>
<li>Γ :   \ followed by G (backslash--usually right above the Enter key--followed by G)</li>
<li>Δ :   \ followed by D</li>
<li>Θ :   \ followed by T</li>
<li>You can get a lot of other Greek letters by typing \ and following it by some alphabetical letter (both upper and lower case). Try it!</li>
<li>∀ :   U (upper case U as in Universal; only if using predicate logic)</li>
<li>∃ :   X (upper case X as in eXists; only if using predicate logic)</li>
<li>≠ :   \ followed by =</li>
<li>brackets:   the editor accepts only one type of brackets--the ordinary parentheses.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following letters cannot be used for sentence, predicate, and term letters:
v, V, U, and X.</p>
<p>For editing the title, you can use |v,|V, |U,|X to get v, V, U, X respectively.</p>
<p>Inference rules must be specified by abbreviations (see README).</p>
<p>Theorems, if allowed, must be specified by abbreviations (see README).</p>
<p>If you need to start counting the lines at something other than 1, click on the first line number and you will be prompted for the desired number for the first line.</p>
