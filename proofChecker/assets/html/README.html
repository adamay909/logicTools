<h3>Online proof checker</h3>
<h3>The proof system</h3>
<p>This proof checker is designed for working with the proof system Gentzen uses in his &quot;Die Wiederspruchsfreiheit der reinen Zahlentheorie&quot; (1936) that I use for teaching  my introductory formal logic course. A proof is stated as a series of sequents where each sequent must have exactly one formula as its succedent. It can be trivially converted to proofs in the style of Lemmon's <em>Beginning Logic</em> as well others influenced by him  like Allen and Hand, <em>Logic Primer</em> (no surprise here since Lemmon's system is, as he says, Gentzen's). E.g., the following proof:</p>
<ol>
<li>P ⊢ P</li>
<li>Q ⊢ Q</li>
<li>P,Q ⊢ P and Q</li>
</ol>
<p>turns into the following in Lemmon's style:</p>
<p>1 (1) P<br>
2 (2) Q<br>
1,2 (3) P and Q</p>
<p>What we do is replace the turnstile with the line  number, and replace formulas on the antecedent side of each sequent with the appropriate line numbers (of course, you need to add appropriate annotations). One thing Gentzen's system allows is the use of placeholders on the antecedent side of a sequent which can be useful (there is an example of that below).</p>
<p>The proof system has 9 inference rules for sentential logic. In the system, you may:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assumption Introduction (A)</strong> Infer s ⊢ s.</li>
<li><strong>Conjunction Introduction (∧I)</strong> From Γ ⊢ s1 and ∆ ⊢ s2 , infer Γ, ∆ ⊢ s1 ∧ s2 .</li>
<li><strong>Conjunction Elimination (∧E)</strong> From Γ ⊢ s1 ∧ s2 , infer Γ ⊢ s1 as well as
Γ ⊢ s2 .</li>
<li><strong>Disjunction Introduction (∨I)</strong> From Γ ⊢ s1 , infer Γ ⊢ s1 ∨ s2 as well as
Γ ⊢ s2 ∨ s1 , for any s2 .</li>
<li><strong>Disjunction Elimination (∨E)</strong> From Γ ⊢ s1 ∨ s2 and s1 , ∆ ⊢ s3 and
s2 , Θ ⊢ s3 , infer Γ, ∆ , Θ ⊢ s3 .</li>
<li><strong>Negation Introduction (¬I)</strong> From Γ, s1 ⊢ s2 and ∆, s1 ⊢ ¬s2 , infer
Γ, ∆ ⊢ ¬s1 .</li>
<li><strong>Negation Elimination (¬E)</strong> From Γ ⊢ ¬¬s, infer Γ ⊢ s.</li>
<li><strong>Conditional Introduction (⊃I)</strong> From Γ , s1 ⊢ s2 , infer Γ ⊢ s1 ⊃ s2 .</li>
<li><strong>Conditional Elimination (⊃E)</strong> From Γ ⊢ s1 ⊃ s2 and ∆ ⊢ s1 , infer Γ, ∆ ⊢ s2 .</li>
</ul>
<p>There are four more rules for predicate logic with quantifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Universal Quantifier Introduction (∀I)</strong> Given a constant κ, from Γ ⊢ φ(κ)
infer Γ ⊢ ∀υφ(υ), provided κ does not appear in any of the sentences
in Γ .</li>
<li><strong>Universal Quantifier Elimination (∀E)</strong> From Γ ⊢ ∀υφ(υ), infer Γ ⊢ φ(κ ),
for any constant κ.</li>
<li><strong>Existential Quantifier Introduction (∃I)</strong> Given a constant κ , infer from
Γ ⊢ φ( κ) to Γ ⊢ ∃υφ(υ).</li>
<li><strong>Existential Quantifier Elimination (∃E)</strong> From Γ ⊢ ∃υφ(υ) and ∆, φ (κ) ⊢ ψ,
infer Γ, ∆ ⊢ ψ , provided κ does not appear in any of Γ, ∆ , and ψ.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, there are two rules for identity (Gentzen does not have these; he uses axioms governing the identity predicate):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity Introduction (=I)</strong> For any constant κ, infer ⊢ κ=κ.</li>
<li><strong>Identity Elimination (=E)</strong> For any constants κ1 and κ2 , infer
⊢ (κ1=κ2 ∧ φ(κ1)) ⊃ φ∗ (κ2) where φ∗ (κ2) is any formula you can
obtain by substituting at least one instance of κ1 in φ with κ2 .</li>
</ul>
<p>For annotations, the proof checker requires you to use the abbreviations given in parentheses.</p>
<p>There are three more rules for rewriting the antecedent side of sequents:</p>
<ul>
<li>You may reorder items within the antecedent of a sequent as you see fit.</li>
<li>You may delete duplicate items within the antecedent of a sequent.</li>
<li>You may add arbitrary items to the antecedent of a sequent.</li>
</ul>
<p>These sequent rewrite rules have no names. When you use them, just give the relevant line numbers in the annotations. The proof checker allows you to use the first two silently. E.g., instead of:</p>
<ol>
<li>P ⊢ P...A</li>
<li>Q ⊢ Q...A</li>
<li>P,Q ⊢ P∧Q...1,2,∧I</li>
<li>P,Q,P ⊢ (P∧Q)∧P...1,3,∧I</li>
<li>P,Q ⊢ (P∧Q)∧P...4</li>
</ol>
<p>you may, but are not required to, write:</p>
<ol>
<li>P ⊢ P...A</li>
<li>Q ⊢ Q...A</li>
<li>P,Q ⊢ P∧Q...1,2,∧I</li>
<li>P,Q ⊢ (P∧Q)∧P...1,3,∧I</li>
</ol>
<p>But you are required to be explicit in the use of the third sequent rewrite rule. E.g., the following is not accepted by the proof checker:</p>
<ol>
<li>Γ ⊢P...premise</li>
<li>Γ ⊢ Q⊃P...1,⊃I</li>
</ol>
<p>You must write the above as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Γ ⊢ P...premise</li>
<li>Γ,Q ⊢ P...1</li>
<li>Γ ⊢ Q⊃P...2,⊃I</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice the use of the keyword &quot;premise&quot; in the annotation. That is what you must use for a premise that is not an assumption (an assumption must take the form s ⊢ s).</p>
<h3>The Proof Checker</h3>
<p>The proof checker checks you whether each line is in accordance with the proof system. But it does not check whether you have managed to show what you set out to show. You'll have to check that yourself---usually a matter of inspecting the last line of your derivation, possibly in combination with the premises.</p>
<h3>The Editor</h3>
<p>The editor is very primitive with limited functionality. You can move the cursor around with the arrow keys, home and end for moving to the start or end of line, and delete and backspace should work more or less normally. But no more advanced navigation around the input area, no positioning the cursor with your mouse,  and no copying and pasting and the like. Given the intended use, it should be enough (it works for me...). While it seems to work with the iOS on-screen keyboard (I have tried it on an iPad Air), it definitely does not work on an Android with an on-screen keyboard. You will need a physical keyboard (even on iOS, using the touch screen keyboard is going to be really slow).</p>
<p>The editor is designed to give a WYSIWYG kind of experience so that what you see on screen is pretty close to what you see in my course material. Some custom key bindings are needed for that. Check the help on how to input symbols.</p>
<p>You can copy the contents of the input area using the &quot;Copy to Clipboard&quot; button. The default is to copy it in plain text. You can switch to Latex output using the toggle button under the settings (labeled &quot;Clipboard:&quot; followed by the current setting). The Latex output is customized for my own use in preparing course material. If you want to make use of the Latex output, you will need the custom commands included with the source files in the source repository.</p>
<h3>Installation</h3>
